# BUILD

To build the project from source use ant from this directory. 
It's necessary to specify the project build file (build_package.xml) and the weka.jar as library. 
Optionally you can set the build command, make_package is the default one.

NOTE: The package has been tested to build and run under Oracle and OpenJDK v1.7 or later.

$ ant -f ./build_package.xml -lib <path-to>/weka.jar make_package


# INSTALL

To install the package on Weka use the GUI of the Weka Package Manager
or use the package manager from the command line as follows:

# Add weka.jar to claspath
$ export CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:<path-to>/weka.jar

$ java weka.core.WekaPackageManager -install-package EntropyTriangle.zip
