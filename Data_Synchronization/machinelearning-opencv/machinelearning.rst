Machine Learning with OpenCV
############################

This document covers the Machine Learning API of the OpenCV2 C++ API. It gives a brief introduction into Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks and shows how it's implemented with OpenCV. Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence and concerned with the question how to make machines able to learn from data. The core idea is to enable a machine to make intelligent decisions and predictions, based on experiences from the past. Algorithms of Machine Learning require interdisciplinary knowledge and often intersect with topics of statistics, mathematics, physics, pattern recognition and more.
