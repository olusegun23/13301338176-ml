The 'phonecalls' data set
=========================

'phonecalls.csv' is a data set that contains 15 features of 3000 phone calls. In my past research, I used this data to show how well mobile phone can predict whether it's owner will pick-up a phone call. The results can be found in "Large-Scale Evaluation of Call-Availability Prediction": http://pielot.org/pubs/Pielot2014-UbiComp-CallAvailability.pdf

'phonecalls.txt' contains the output of WEKA's console when using this data set to create a RandomForest (with 'printTree' option enabled).


The features are:

* Day: Day of the week. Ranges from 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday)
* Hour: Hour of the day. Ranges from 0 (Midnight) to 23 hours
* RingerMode:	Ringer mode: "Normal" = audible ring, "Vibrate" = vibration alarm only, "Silent" = no sound or vibration
* RingerModeChangedMin: Time in minutes since the ringer mode was last changed
* Charging: Indicates whether the phone is connected to USB or charged (1) or not (0)
* ChargingChangedMin: Time in minutes since the phone was last (un)plugged
* ScreenOn: Indicates whether the screen was on (1) or off (0) prior to the call. This variable is robust to the fact that an incoming call will turn on the screen.
* ScreenChangedMin: Time in minutes since the screen was last turned on or off
* Proximity: Indicates whether the proximity sensor on the front of the screen was covered (1) or not (0) when the call arrived
* Pitch: Pitch angle of the phone when call started: 0 = phone lies parallel to surface, 45 degree means screen points towards user's face
* MaxAcc: Maximum acceleration in G measured while the phone was ringing
* CalledHowManyTimes: Indicates how often the same person has called before
* TimeSinceLastCall: Time in minutes since the last incoming call
* LastCallPicked: Indicates whether the last call was picked up (1) or not (0)
* Picked (ground truth): Indicates whether the user has picked up this the call (picked) or not (baseline)
